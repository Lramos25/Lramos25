# I am a Software Developer

Hello, I am Luis and I currently live in the Denver, Co area. I enjoy working with Python and SQL for various analytical projects but I also enjoy working with various logical designs and data structures in C++. I am currently learning the MERN stack, while practicing with C++ and working to soak up knowledge from others as I can. I used my knowledge in coding to excel in my previous career and am now looking to grow as a software developer. Changing careers is challenging and exciting with an element of unease making this the best journey of my life so far.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Database optimization / AWS / MERN 


Skills: SQL / PYTHON3 / C++ / HTML / CSS / JS
